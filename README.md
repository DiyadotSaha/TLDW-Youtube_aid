Too Long; Didn't watch is an AI-powered Streamlit app that helps users digest long-form educational YouTube videos by summarizing the content and generating an interactive quiz from the transcript.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Streamlit, Whisper, Gemini (Google Generative AI), HuggingFace Summarizer, HTML/CSS (via Streamlit)

This project uses the `pytubefix` library to download audio from YouTube and `whisper` to transcribe spoken content to text. The transcript is then summarized using both extractive (`bert-extractive-summarizer`) and abstractive (`pysummarization`) techniques.

The standout feature is the **AI-generated quiz**, powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, which parses the transcript and constructs multiple-choice questions. Users get instant feedback (correct/incorrect) and scores, creating a more active and engaging learning experience.

The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, providing a clean, responsive interface with embedded video, summaries, transcripts, and interactive quiz components.

## Optimizations

- Used `st.session_state` to persist user answers and prevent data loss between reruns.
- Prevented radio buttons from pre-selecting answers with `index=None`, forcing user engagement.
- Modularized Gemini prompt + parsing logic for future extensions like flashcard generation or explanations.
- Cached transcription and summarization logic for improved performance.

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me learn how to **chain together multiple AI components** â€” transcription, summarization, and quiz generation â€” into a seamless pipeline. I also learned how to create a clean, responsive Streamlit interface that handles state changes well.

I gained valuable experience working with **real-world audio transcription** using Whisper, API integration with Googleâ€™s LLMs, and UX considerations for quiz interactivity.
